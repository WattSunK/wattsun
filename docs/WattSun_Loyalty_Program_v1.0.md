# WattSun Loyalty Program

## Overview

The WattSun Loyalty Program is designed to reward active users, especially staff, with daily point accruals, periodic digests, and point withdrawal options. It is built on top of the existing WattSun SQLite infrastructure and includes admin-manageable settings, automated scripts, and customer-facing pages.

## Functional Scope

| Component                | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Daily Accrual**       | +1 point/day for active accounts (cron script) |
| **Withdrawals**         | Redeem points if min balance met, with admin approval |
| **Penalty System**      | -1 point per infraction (manual/admin) |
| **Weekly Digest**       | Enqueue summary emails to active users |
| **Admin Settings**      | Configure eligibility, duration, thresholds, activation |
| **Status Changes**      | Activate, pause, or close user accounts |
| **Customer View**       | Member page: summary, history, withdrawal form |
| **Notification Worker** | Background process to email queued events |
