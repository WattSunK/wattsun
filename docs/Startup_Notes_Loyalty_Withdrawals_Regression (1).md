# üßæ Startup Notes ‚Äî Loyalty Withdrawals Regression
_Date: 10 Oct 2025_

---

## üß© 1Ô∏è‚É£ Context & Initial Problem

The **Loyalty Withdrawals Regression** investigation began after inconsistencies were detected in:
- **Account Balances**
- **Earned / Penalty / Paid** totals
- **Enrollment notifications** not queuing correctly

Symptoms:
1. Penalties and withdrawals were subtracting **both balance and earned**, violating the intended design.
2. Enrollment via `admin-loyalty.js` failed to respect program settings (duration, signup bonus).
3. Welcome message notifications caused DB errors:
   ```
   SQLITE_CONSTRAINT: NOT NULL constraint failed: notifications_queue.payload
   ```
4. Some accounts showed balance deducted but `total_paid` not incremented upon payout.
5. Enrollment occasionally failed with:
   ```
   SQLITE_CONSTRAINT: UNIQUE constraint failed: loyalty_ledger.account_id, loyalty_ledger.kind
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2Ô∏è‚É£ What Has Been Fixed

| Area | Fix Summary | Status |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **Withdrawal creation** | Adjusted logic so withdrawals only subtract from `points_balance`, not from `total_earned`. | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| **Penalty handling** | Created standalone `penalty` path updating `total_penalty` only (no impact on earned). | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| **Enrollment logic** | Enrollment now uses admin-program duration and signup bonus (3 mo / 100 pts). | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| **Welcome notifications** | Updated insert to include `payload` JSON column to satisfy schema. | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| **DB triggers** | Removed `trg_ll_after_insert_recalc` and `trg_ll_after_delete_recalc` that caused double-counts. | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| **Rollback safety** | Added better try/catch wrapping so failed inserts no longer rollback account creation. | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| **Ledger math** | Sign-up bonus correctly logs to ledger and updates totals. | ‚úÖ Fixed |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 3Ô∏è‚É£ Outstanding Issues (as of 10 Oct 2025)

| Issue | Observation | Impact |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Balance and Paid mismatch** | New withdrawals reduce balance but `total_paid` not updated after payout confirmation. | Medium |
| **Unique constraint on enrollment** | Some accounts trigger `UNIQUE(account_id, kind)` in `loyalty_ledger`. Possibly due to re-enrollment without cleanup. | Medium |
| **Notification enqueue** | `payload` insertion logic still occasionally skipped due to missing user email. | Low |
| **Trigger cascade absence** | With removed triggers, `total_earned` must always be updated manually post-insert. | Medium |

## üîç 4Ô∏è‚É£ Verification Snapshot

### Example (User ID 18)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Balance | 726 |
| Earned | 823 |
| Penalty | 10 |
| Paid | 47 |
| Ledger Rows | Withdraw(10,12), Penalty(11) |

### Example (User ID 1)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Balance | 0 |
| Earned | 0 |
| Paid | 0 |
| Issue | Ledger updated, totals not reflected |

## üß™ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Next Regression Tests

### (A) Enrollment Regression Retest
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/admin/loyalty/accounts   -b admin.jar -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{"userId":7}'
sqlite3 /volume1/web/wattsun/data/dev/wattsun.dev.db "
SELECT id,user_id,points_balance,total_earned
FROM loyalty_accounts ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;
SELECT kind,status,payload FROM notifications_queue WHERE kind='loyalty_welcome' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;
"
```

‚úÖ Expected:
- Account created with `balance=100`, `earned=100`.
- `notifications_queue.payload` contains JSON message.

---

### (B) Withdrawal Life Cycle Retest
1. **Create new withdrawal** (deduct balance only).
2. **Approve & mark paid** ‚Üí increment `total_paid`.
3. Verify totals:
   ```bash
   SELECT points_balance,total_paid,total_earned,total_penalty
   FROM loyalty_accounts WHERE user_id=TEST_USER;
   ```

‚úÖ Expected:
- Balance reduces by withdrawal points.
- Total_paid increases by same amount.

---

### (C) Penalty Path Regression
Confirm:
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/admin/loyalty/penalize   -b admin.jar -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{"userId":TEST_USER,"points":10,"note":"Penalty regression test"}'
```

‚úÖ Expected:
- `total_penalty` += 10  
- `points_balance` -= 10  
- No impact on `total_earned`.

---

## üß± 6Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps

1. Refactor `loyalty_withdrawals.js` to:
   - Increment `total_paid` on status=‚ÄúPaid‚Äù.
   - Enforce idempotency via dedupe key.
2. Review `notifications_queue` inserts:
   - Ensure fallback email or default payload for missing addresses.
3. Run `tests/loyalty_regression_fullcycle.sh` (to be generated next).
4. Add SQL health check for mismatched aggregates.

## üèÅ 7Ô∏è‚É£ Definition of Done for Regression Cycle
‚úÖ Enrollment reflects program settings  
‚úÖ Notifications enqueue successfully (no NULL payloads)  
‚úÖ Withdrawals deduct balance and increment paid  
‚úÖ Penalties update only penalty column  
‚úÖ Balances reconcile with ledger totals
