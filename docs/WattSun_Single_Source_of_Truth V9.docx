## Phase 6 – Admin Status Update Tool

- **6.0 Core Restore** ✅
- **6.1 Orders List wired** ✅
- **6.2 View/Edit modal wiring** ✅
- **6.3 Backend routes mounted** ✅
- **6.4 Customer Reflection** ⏸ In progress
- **Persistence Bug** ⚠️
  - Admin Save (status/driver/notes) updates inline but does not persist beyond hard refresh.
  - Root cause under investigation.
  - Task carried forward to next phase.

## Pending Tasks
- Debug persistence of admin save:
  - Confirm PATCH actually sent (console + network logging).
  - Validate payload against backend contract (`driverId` vs `driver_id`, `note` vs `notes`).
  - Ensure overlay table merged into Orders list read path.
