# WattSun Loyalty Program â€” v4 (2025-09-23)

## Overview
The WattSun Loyalty Program rewards active users and staff with daily point accruals, periodic digests, and point withdrawal options.  
It is built on the existing WattSun SQLite infrastructure and includes:

- Admin-managed settings  
- Automated scripts (daily accrual, weekly digest)  
- Customer-facing history/summary pages  
- Notification worker for emails  

Points accrue at **+1/day** while the account is Active. Points can be redeemed (EUR equivalent) subject to eligibility and admin approval. Admins may also post penalties.
